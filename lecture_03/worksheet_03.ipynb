    "\n",
    "Imagine you and your friend are comparing two gene expression values across multiple genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you use Euclidean Distance (p=2p=2), you consider all differences together to measure similarity.\n",

    "No. The Minkowski distance is not a distance function when p < 1. The reason is that the triangle inequality is not satisfied. The triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. When p < 1, the triangle inequality is violated, and the Minkowski distance is not a metric."
